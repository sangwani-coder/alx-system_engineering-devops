# Load balancer
In this project I will be learning about load balancing will make improvements to my web stack so that there is **redundancy** for my web servers.
Load balancing will allow the server to receive more traffic by doubling the number of web servers, and make the infrastructure more reliable. If one web server fails, I will still have a second one to handle requests.
## load balancing and HAproxy

HAProxy, which stands for High Availability Proxy, is a popular open source software TCP/HTTP Load Balancer and proxying solution which can be run on Linux, Solaris, and FreBSD. Its most common use is to improve the performance and reliability os a server environment by distributing the workload across multiple servers(e.g. Web, application, database). It is used in many high profile environments, including: GitHub, Imgur, Instagram, and Twitter.

For this project I will be writing bash scripts to automate the work. All scripts will be dsigned to configure a brand new Ubuntu server to match the task requirements.
